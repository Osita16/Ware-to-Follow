### Meet Rover, a Little Robot with a Big Problem!

Welcome to the Smart Rover Project! Our friend Rover is a new helper bot designed to follow black lines in a warehouse. It's a simple job, but the warehouse is a busy place, and sometimes boxes are left on the lines.

**The Problem:** Rover is great at following lines, but it has no idea how to see obstacles. It just keeps going until... **BUMP!** It crashes and gets stuck.

**Our Goal:** We need to work together to upgrade Rover's code. We'll teach it how to use its sensors to see obstacles, stop, and navigate around them safely.

### üìù Our To-Do List

We have a few tasks to complete to make Rover smarter. You can find the details for each task in the [**Issues Tab**](https://github.com/YourUsername/smart-rover-project/issues).

* **Task 1:** Teach Rover to stop when something is in front of it.
* **Task 2:** Help Rover figure out how to get back to the line after avoiding an obstacle.
* **Task 3:** Give Rover a beeping sound to alert people when it sees an obstacle.
* **Task 4:** Help Rover adjust its sensors for better line-following.
* **Task 5:** Create a simple wiring diagram so others can build their own Rover.
